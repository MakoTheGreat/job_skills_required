To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.

Profisee is a growing Microsoft gold-certified partner focused on data management solutions in general and, more specifically, in the area of Master Data Management.

Profisee is looking for Software Developer Interns to help accelerate the value R&D delivers to our customers, partners, and internal stakeholders by delivering innovative new features that will strengthen Profisee’s position as a leader in the MDM space. We work with leading-edge technology, and you will have the opportunity to develop your skills towards a full-stack engineering profile while working on both web front-end, business tier, and data tier in both an on-premise as well as cloud technology environment.

This exciting opportunity will be hybrid and the incoming interns will work out of our headquarters in Alpharetta, GA. Our teams typically come into the office 2-3 days a week so we will need you to be able to join us. We are focusing on finding local candidates as relocation is not available at this time. The Software Developer Interns will report to a Development Team Lead and you will work within a development team alongside other developers and QA peers.

What You Will Accomplish

Primary Objective: Contribute to the design, development, and delivery of new features in the Profisee Platform. This begins by working with your Team Lead and team members to understand new feature requirements, including their underlying business drivers and benefits. Once understood, you will work with other developers, Team Leads and architects to design new features and decompose them into user stories. For stories assigned to you, you will work to check in completed user stories, including technical implementation with supporting unit tests, and then collaborate with QA on testing and resolution of any bugs.

Be Innovative: Help Profisee push the envelope around technology innovation in the area of Master Data Management software. Profisee is evolving our software architecture towards a cloud-native architecture deployed using containers and microservices. Interns must be eager to tackle new technologies and challenges we encounter along that journey, including the delivery of new components as microservices, or breaking existing components out as they’re evolved to the new microservices architecture. Interns must be willing to continually learn, evaluate, and propose new technologies and approaches which can be used to deliver innovative features in the product.

Be Agile: Profisee employs an Agile methodology for software development. Everyone in R&D should be comfortable working within an Agile software development environment.

Our capacity to grow both professionally and personally is unlimited. If you want to be surrounded by a team that believes in and supports your ability to challenge yourself and, occasionally make mistakes as long as we learn from them, then Profisee is the place for you. You’ll be supported in keeping your skills current and sharing your knowledge through our DevTalks, sprint reviews, and book clubs where like-minded Developers explore new and emerging technologies.

Benefits

Why We Think You Should Come Work With Us:

Constructive Candor: Everyone knows how each other feels when we leave a room. We enjoy diverse perspectives with the purpose of finding the best answer, not defending our own.

111,Open Source Software Engineering Intern,"Eventual San Francisco, CA On-site",Internship · Internship,"About the job
About Eventual

At Eventual (YC W22), we are building Daft, the open-source framework for processing complex data.

Data processing systems today are highly optimized for simple tabular data. However, much of the useful data in the world is in a more complex form, such as media (e.g. images, video, audio), scientific formats (e.g. genomes), and ML artifacts (e.g. embeddings). There are many challenges today that make processing complex data much more difficult than working with simple tabular data. Our goal is to make working with complex data as easy as working with simple data, and become the de-facto solution for building applications on top of complex data.

You would be joining a small, fast-moving team of engineers with deep expertise across related domains: big data, distributed systems, machine learning, self-driving, genomics, and high performance computing.

About The Role

As a software engineering intern, your primary responsibilities would be contributing to the development of the open-source Daft distributed dataframe. Development moves quickly here, but here are some projects you might expect to work on:
Implementing algorithms on complex data types, such as embedding similarity or image kernels
Improving performance of distributed join operations
Building integrations for high-performance data loading
We are a young startup, so do be prepared to wear many hats - tinkering with infrastructure, talking to users, and participating in design processes with the team!

About You

You will want to be comfortable working on a novel distributed data processing system. Some things that will be important are:
Industry or research experience working with distributed systems, especially data-intensive systems such as Spark, Dask, or Ray.
Experience with Arrow-based frameworks.
Familiarity with Python or Rust.
A strong sense of ownership and autonomy; a desire to build good systems for users.
Big nice to haves are: 1. Experience working on production machine learning systems. 2. Experience with compilers or query optimization.

Office And Benefits

Our office setup is hybrid remote, with three in-person days a week. We are in our San Francisco office Wednesday to Friday."

113,Software Engineering Intern,"LobbyingData.com Santa Monica, CA",Internship · Internship,"About the job
Did you know that lobbyists in the United States successfully influenced the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to label all imported catfish from Vietnam as “Swi,” effectively creating a new species of fish identical to catfish.

In 2020, the camera company Kodak lobbied the White House for a government loan to produce COVID emergency supplies, and actually got a loan two weeks later of $700 million (the news of the loan also sent their stock price from $2 to $32). General Motors also teased the new crab-walking electric hummer in a lobbying report weeks before they made a public announcement.

On a daily basis, hundreds of companies are lobbying the government to secure massive loans, to persuade the government to rewrite laws to benefit their company plans, and to fight for government contracts. However, info on lobbying activity is incredibly difficult to access and understand.

LobbyingData.com is a startup data provider in the alternative data industry, offering the first and only intuitive data source from American lobbying. With more than 1.6 million lobbying contracts in our database, LobbyingData.com has captured and tracked the entire history of recorded American lobbying from 1999 - present, adding transparency to an industry that has been deliberately shrouded in convolution and secrecy making access to the information nearly impossible for the public, until now.

We are looking for a fully remote spring 2023 software engineering intern to join our team starting March 2023 and focus on using AI models to exploring our lobbying database and create applications to shed a light on corporate lobbying activities, link lobbying activity to market movements and news, and design models, metrics, reports and dashboards that will be used to help our customers better understand the lobbying industry, and how they along with the general public could gain valuable insight from American lobbying.

Specific Responsibilities Include
Work with business owners and stakeholders to formulate hypotheses and help drive smarter decisions to deliver better products and features.
Based on customer feedback on products, generate interesting research questions and answer them with data.
Design and develop applications, models, metrics, reports, and data visualizations to help our customers better understand the lobbying industry.
Merge in external data sources like Stock Market data to create public-facing research reports on different companies that have lobbied the government.
Required Qualifications
Currently pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree with technical exposure to data analysis
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Requests)
SQL (Working knowledge required)
Front End Frameworks (React)
Some Familiarity with APIs
A passion for exposing money in American politics
LobbyingData.com is committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

NOTE: This is an unpaid internship, but we offer college credit. Please check with your academic advisor to ensure this internship meets your college/university's guidelines for credit.

Interested candidates should send their resume, and a very brief cover letter detailing their interest in joining the team, and availability to contact@lobbyingdata.com. We look forward to reviewing your application."

To support this important work, the administration has committed $5 billion in new capital funding, bringing the 10-year planned investment in housing to $22 billion—the largest in the city’s history.

We care about your well-being. We offer flexible working hours and remote options. We offer health, dental, and vision benefits for employees and their dependents. We also offer 12 weeks of parental leave (20 for birthing mothers) and unlimited paid time off.

We support our employees wherever they are. While we have office spaces in NYC and Paris, we're very distributed and all remote employees have the opportunity to visit our offices. If needed, we'll also outfit your workstation to ensure you succeed.

We want our teammates to be shareholders. All employees have company equity as part of their compensation package. If we succeed in becoming a category-defining platform in machine learning and artificial intelligence, everyone enjoys the upside.

We support the community. We believe major scientific advancements are the result of collaboration across the field. Join a community supporting the ML/AI community.

We are actively working to build a culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusivity. We are intentionally building a workplace where people feel respected and supported—regardless of who you are or where you come from. We believe this is foundational to building a great company and community.

305,Metaverse Research Scientist Intern,"Cesium Philadelphia, PA On-site",Internship · Internship,"About the job
These are exciting times for developing the concept of the metaverse into deployable systems. Numerous problems need to be addressed covering interoperability, standards, asset management, model transfer across applications, architectural trade-offs between cloud, edge, and end-user platforms, and what activities will capture the interest of participants and economic value for technology providers. Cesium is already a major player in this arena with its 3D geospatial tiles and open interoperability standards.

Our research team, led by 2021 SIGGRAPH Academy inductee Dr. Norm Badler, has identified a new area that capitalizes upon the 3D Tiles spatial data structure to prescribe animatable 3D content for metaverse entities such as digital twins. The goal is to manage (animate and render) tens of thousands of discrete entities in real-time. At its core is an action representation that lies atop the usual low level graphics transformation structure. Ideally the action representation will possess rich semantic (prescriptive) power, scalability to metaverse-sized environments, and integration with appropriate software such as Unreal Engine.

Cesium is seeking applications for a research internship position beginning January 2023 or summer 2023 to work toward this goal.

What you’ll do:
Collaborate with industry-leading partners.
Gain a working understanding of Behavior Trees, Unreal Engine, NVIDIA Project Anywhere, Omniverse specifications, and action representations.
Research, design, specify, develop, program, integrate, and demonstrate a viable real time action representation processing environment.
Measure and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of this representation to achieve massive entity animation scalability.

What we're looking for:
Excellent Unreal Engine, Blueprint, and C++ development skills with a focus on modular architecture, Behavior Trees, API design, and performance.
Experience in 3D graphics, animation, modeling, and machine learning are desirable.
Experience with graphics techniques is preferred: such as spatial data structures, shaders, level of detail, rigging, and animation methods and tools.
Experience with any flavor of parallel programming is a bonus: multicore, SIMD, GPU, etc.
Knowledge of basic AI notions of object, action, and movement representation and semantics.
MS or PhD candidate in Computer Science preferred. Top BS students considered.

Cesium offers
Competitive base salary and bonus
Learning opportunities including workshops and Kindle or Audible credits
Frequent team social events
Center city office, just steps from public transit
Free lunch, snacks, and drinks at the office

Cesium was awarded
2020 Technology Startup Enterprise Award by the Philadelphia Alliance for Capital and Technologies (PACT)
2020 Startup of the Year in the Geospatial World Awards by Geospatial Media and Communications
One of Philadelphia's Best Places to Work in Tech 2020 by Tech in Motion

This position is located in our Philadelphia, PA office.

We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and invite candidates from all different backgrounds to bring their unique perspective to Cesium."
